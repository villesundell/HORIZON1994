Thanks to [Valentin Fran√ßois](https://github.com/ValentinFrancois) for the [pixels2svg](https://github.com/ValentinFrancois/pixels2svg) Python library, which was used to generate the SVGs!

With small modifications, you can adapt the [generate_font_files.py](./generate_font_files.py) script for any "SVG to font files" project (especially for monospaced fonts).
